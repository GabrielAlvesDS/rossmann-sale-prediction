# Rossmann sales prediction model

This is a sales prediction project for a drugstore chain.

## Business Question
Rossmann Drug Stores' CFO asked for a sales forecast for each store over the next six weeks in order to set a budget for store renovations. To obtain results with a higher level of precision, we created a machine learning model and made it available for consultation through a telegram bot.
## Introducing the dataset
The dataset provides historical (daily) data on sales made by the 1,115 stores over 2 years and 7 months, and other information such as:
- Total sale in that day
- Number of consumers
- Whether the store was open or closed
- If it was a holiday (Christmas, Easter or Public Holiday)
- If it was a school holiday
- Type of store
- Level of product variety
- Distance to nearest competitor
- Closest competitor opening date
- If the store was on sale on the day
- If the store participated in the 2nd promotion
- Date on which the store started participating in the 2nd promotion
- Consecutive intervals (months) in which the 2nd promotion started
